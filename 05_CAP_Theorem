# CAP Theorem

##  Definition
The CAP Theorem is a principle in distributed systems that states it is impossible for a system to guarantee
all three of the following at the same time: **Consistency**, **Availability**, and **Partition Tolerance**. You can only choose two out of the three.


##  Why It’s Important
Distributed systems like cloud databases often have to work even when parts of the network fail. The CAP Theorem helps developers understand the trade-offs they must make when building such systems. It explains why some systems prioritize availability while others focus on consistency.

## How It Works
- **Consistency** means every user sees the same data, even if they access it from different servers.
- **Availability** means every request gets a response, even if it might not be the most recent data.
- **Partition Tolerance** means the system continues to work even when there are network failures between servers.

The theorem says you can only fully achieve two at a time. For example, if you want consistency and availability, your system may not tolerate network partitions well.

##  Real-world Examples
- **CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):** HBase, MongoDB (in some settings)
- **AP Systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance):** CouchDB, Cassandra
- **CA Systems (Consistency + Availability):** These are possible only when the system is not distributed (i.e., no partition).

##  Trade-offs
You must decide which two properties are most important based on your application. For example, a banking system must be consistent, while a messaging app may favor availability. Choosing the wrong combination can lead to poor user experience or even data loss.

##  When to Use / When Not To
Use the CAP Theorem as a guiding principle when designing any system that will be distributed or run across multiple servers. It’s not useful for simple, single-server applications. Also, it does not mean you get zero of the third property — it means you may have to compromise on it during failures.
