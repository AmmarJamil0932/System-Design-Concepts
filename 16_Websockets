# WebSockets

##  Definition
WebSockets is a communication protocol that allows a continuous, two-way connection between a client (like a browser) and a server. 
Unlike regular HTTP requests, WebSockets stay open and allow real-time data exchange.

##  Why Itâ€™s Important
WebSockets enable live interactions such as chat messages, stock price updates, notifications, or multiplayer gaming. 
They reduce the delay and overhead of making a new HTTP request for every update.

## How It Works
After an initial handshake using HTTP, the connection is upgraded to WebSocket. 
From then on, both the client and server can send and receive messages anytime over the same open connection. 
This reduces latency and improves responsiveness.

##  Real-world Examples
WebSockets are used by apps like WhatsApp Web, Slack, online gaming platforms, trading dashboards, and live sports score updates. 
Any app that shows real-time information can benefit from WebSockets.

##  Trade-offs
WebSockets keep a connection open, which uses more server resources compared to stateless HTTP. 
They can also be harder to scale and secure, especially with firewalls or load balancers that don't support them well.

##  When to Use / When Not To
Use WebSockets for apps that need live updates, like messaging, games, or dashboards. 
Avoid them for simple apps with mostly static content or occasional user interaction where regular HTTP is sufficient.
