# Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

##  Definition
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a group of distributed servers placed in different locations that deliver web content 
(like images, videos, or scripts) to users from the server closest to them.

##  Why It’s Important
When users are far from your main server, loading content can be slow. CDNs speed up delivery by serving content from a nearby
server. This improves user experience and reduces load on your origin server.

## How It Works
When a user requests a file, the CDN checks if it already has a cached copy. If yes, it serves the file from the nearest edge server.
If not, it fetches it from the original server, saves a copy, and delivers it. Future users near that location will get the cached version.

##  Real-world Examples
Popular websites like YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon use CDNs to serve videos, images, and scripts quickly across the globe. Major 
CDN providers include Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS CloudFront, and Google Cloud CDN.

##  Trade-offs
While CDNs improve speed and reduce bandwidth usage, they can introduce complexity in cache invalidation and version control.
Also, there's a cost involved, especially for large-scale usage.

##  When to Use / When Not To
Use a CDN when your app has users in multiple regions or serves large static files like images and videos. It’s also useful for
reducing load on your origin server. Avoid it for fully dynamic data that changes too frequently or small internal apps.
