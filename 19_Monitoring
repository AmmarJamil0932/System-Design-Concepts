# Monitoring

##  Definition
Monitoring is the process of observing and tracking the performance, health, and behavior of a system in real-time. 
It helps detect issues, measure usage, and ensure everything is running as expected.

##  Why Itâ€™s Important
Monitoring helps you know if something is wrong before your users do. 
It allows you to catch errors, slow responses, or high resource usage early, so you can fix problems quickly and avoid downtime.

## How It Works
Monitoring tools collect data like CPU usage, memory, errors, response times, and more. 
They display this information in dashboards and send alerts if something unusual happens. 
There are two types of monitoring: system monitoring (infrastructure) and application monitoring (code-level performance).

##  Real-world Examples
Companies like Netflix and Google use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, and Datadog to monitor their systems. 
For example, if a server gets overloaded, an alert is triggered and the issue is investigated immediately.

##  Trade-offs
Setting up monitoring requires time, tools, and configuration. 
Too many alerts can overwhelm teams (alert fatigue), and poor dashboard design may hide critical information. 
Choosing what to monitor and setting the right thresholds is key.

##  When to Use / When Not To
Monitoring is essential for any production system, even small ones. 
For personal projects, simple logging or basic uptime checks might be enough, but for apps with users, real monitoring is a must.
