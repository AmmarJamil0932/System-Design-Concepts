# Microservices

##  Definition
Microservices is an architectural style where a large application is broken into smaller, independent services. 
Each service focuses on a single business function and communicates with others through APIs.

##  Why Itâ€™s Important
Microservices make it easier to build, scale, and maintain large systems. 
Each service can be developed, tested, deployed, and updated independently, allowing faster releases and better fault isolation.

## How It Works
Instead of one large application (monolith), the system is split into many smaller services. 
For example, in an e-commerce system, one service handles payments, another handles inventory, and another handles user accounts. 
Services communicate over protocols like HTTP or messaging queues.

##  Real-world Examples
Companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify use microservices to build and scale their applications. 
Netflix has hundreds of microservices that work together to stream movies and TV shows to millions of users.

##  Trade-offs
Microservices can introduce complexity. 
Managing many services, handling network issues, data consistency, and debugging across services can be challenging. 
You also need tools for service discovery, monitoring, and deployment.

##  When to Use / When Not To
Use microservices when building large applications with multiple teams or when you need to scale different parts of your system independently. 
Avoid them for small projects where a simple monolithic design is faster and easier to manage.
